    I‚Äôm just getting this error: ‚Äújava.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.‚Äù
    Smack version 4.1.7

        Looks like it has something to do with your servers ssl certificate‚Äôs configuration.Are you sure it is properly configured?I would try with a public server I know to be working and start working out the problem from there.Hope this helps.

                While disabling security may work fine while testing,it is recommended to set up security.It really isn‚Äôt that hard to set up.I have a recent tutorial on how to set up a certificate for a web server :

                http://www.blikoon.com/tips-and-tricks/secure-your-nginx-site-with-letsencrypt-free-certificates

                May be should adapt that to xmpp servers üôÇ

        Is it Spark or Rooster not receiving the message?If all else fails I would download the source code from github and work my way back from there.

    hi, can you please guide me on how to reconnect to xmpp server? the case is when i try login and connects its working fine, and then when all of a sudden internet is not there it closes the connection. when internet comes back i have added to reconnect. the reconnection connects to xmpp and then shows stream conflict saying that Client is already logged in. can you help me with this? what is the proper reconnection process?

    thanks.

        The issue you are facing is because Rooster does not handle stream / connection management.Rooster is kind of a getting started guide on smack .If you want a proper client that takes care of all those details (that uses smack) please have a look at xaber . Conversations is another client worth a look at that takes care of these issues,(it doesn‚Äôt use smack but the underlying concepts are the same.)

        I don‚Äôt know about jappix web version so I can‚Äôt be of help here.(May be it is filtering messages from unkown resources?). But any standard xmpp client should be able to receive messages sent by Rooster.

        Hello Zine,
        You don‚Äôt need to declare the server anywhere in the source code.If your server is live and some ip address or domain ,you just need to login with the jid(user@server.com) and password. I happen to also have a tutorial on the basics of xmpp :

    First of all, thanks for your generous work, your two recent tutorials (this one and about ReceiverView with MVC concept) are very detailed and well-written.

    During the execution of this exercise I‚Äôve found an minor bug in your instructions.
    LoginActivity misses mContext variable assignment, this results in the error shown below:
    java.lang.RuntimeException: Error receiving broadcast Intent { act=rooster.uiauthenticated flg=0x10 pkg=rooster } in rooster.LoginActivity$3@c09717e
    Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method ‚Äòjava.lang.String android.content.Context.getPackageName()‚Äô on a null object reference

    To fix the issue, replace it reference in onResume method of LoginActivity with context variable already passes as a parameter, like this:
    Intent i2 = new Intent(context,ContactListActivity.class);

    Hey!
    Thanks very much for the tutorial. I have downloaded the source from github. I am using an open fire xmpp server. I have two test users created.

    I am able to login using the users from two separate devices. And I have changed a row in the contact model to the corresponding username. Eg: ‚Äúusername‚Äù@ipaddress. But when I send messages, the other device doesn‚Äôt receive any.

    Any help is appreciated.

        Hello Rao,
        May be a problem with the server(Openfire) filtering out messages?I have tested this only with an ejabberd server and it worked.If possible please test with other publicly known servers like ‚Äúxmpp.jp‚Äù.I wish I had time to investigate more on this and help but I don‚Äôt right now.

        Dear Daniel !! Very nice of you for such a detailed tutorial and keep up the work !!
        This tutorial really serves good knowledge for understanding XMPP chat.

        But I am stuck on a issue and it is also reported by other as I can see in the comments too, I think you are not able to reproduce it, please help us out. I followed the following steps:

        1. After downloading and successfully building your project from Github,

        2. Created two test users abc@xmpp.jp and xyz@xmpp.jp.

        3. Now in order to make them communicate with each other, I have to create two different logins i.e. one from abc@xmpp.jp and other from xyz@xmpp.jp and add vice versa to contact list of each other.

        4. So, to do this I modified the contactModel class and added contact abc@xmpp.jp and logged in from credentials of xyz@xmpp.jp.

        private void populateWithInitialContacts(Context context)
        {
        //Create the Foods and add them to the list;

        Contact contact1 = new Contact(‚Äúabc@xmpp.jp‚Äù);
        mContacts.add(contact1);
        }

        5. And to prepare other client I added contact xyz@xmpp.jp and logged in from credentials of abc@xmpp.jp.

        private void populateWithInitialContacts(Context context)
        {
        //Create the Foods and add them to the list;

        Contact contact1 = new Contact(‚Äúxyz@xmpp.jp‚Äù);
        mContacts.add(contact1);
        }

        6. Now,I have two different devices ready to communicate with each other such that I have abc@xmpp.jp in contact list of xyz@xmpp.jp and vice versa.

        7. But, when I select the contact to send the message there is no message received at the other end. However, In a case where sender and receiver is same message is received i.e. login from abc@xmpp.jp and adding abc@xmmpp.jp to contact list.

        I am helpless because I have invested much time in this tutorial and this tutorial is just what I need to start with. I would request some of your time to this issue, only then it will solve your purpose and benefit learners like us.

        Thanks in advance.

        Hi.You probably need to install your server on a machine with a publicly accessible IP address or domain name.

    Hello Daniel,

    Thanks for such an awesome Article‚Ä¶!
    I followed it and implemented small chatting module using Openfire.

    I need your help, on one more functionality, how to get one to one chat history on mobile from server to device?

    Currently I am using MamManager from Smack. But MamManager.isSupportedByServer() is returning false.
    I referred some links which tells that have to add Monitoring service on Openfire but still returning same I am using Openfire 4.1.0 & Smack 4.2.0-beta2.

    Thanks

        Hello David,Thanks for the kind comment.
        Unfortunately I don‚Äôt use Openfire and I have no idea as to why retrieving Mam history is not working for you.If you join this muc ‚Äúopen_chat@conference.igniterealtime.org‚Äù you may get in touch with people that can help.The developpers of both smack and Openfire are
        pretty active in there and you might get a better response.Cheers!

    Hi Daniel,

    I‚Äôve setup my own XMPP server in Ubuntu using .deb installer file. Now when I‚Äôm trying to connect to the XMPP server from my Android client using XMPPTCPConnection it is failing with SSLHandshakeException ‚ÄúConnection closed with error javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found‚Äù.

    Could you throw some light on what‚Äôs going wrong here and how would I be able to fix the problem?

        Hi,
        You probably need to configure ssl certificates for your server to be able to connect with tls.Or you can disable encrypted connections in your client.But disabling encrypted connections is very dangerous you should do this ONLY in test environements.
        Good luck.

                Something like this:
                xmppConfig.setSecurityMode(ConnectionConfiguration.SecurityMode.disabled);
                in your connection routine.This is off the top my head and I haven‚Äôt used smack for a while.You should check the official API just to play it safe.
                Good luck.

    Dear Daniel !! Very nice of you for such a detailed tutorial and keep up the work !!
    This tutorial really serves good knowledge for understanding XMPP chat.

    But I am stuck on a issue and it is also reported by other as I can see in the comments too, I think you are not able to reproduce it, please help us out. I followed the following steps:

    1. After downloading and successfully building your project from Github,

    2. Created two test users abc@xmpp.jp and xyz@xmpp.jp.

    3. Now in order to make them communicate with each other, I have to create two different logins i.e. one from abc@xmpp.jp and other from xyz@xmpp.jp and add vice versa to contact list of each other.

    4. So, to do this I modified the contactModel class and added contact abc@xmpp.jp and logged in from credentials of xyz@xmpp.jp.

    private void populateWithInitialContacts(Context context)
    {
    //Create the Foods and add them to the list;

    Contact contact1 = new Contact(‚Äúabc@xmpp.jp‚Äù);
    mContacts.add(contact1);
    }

    5. And to prepare other client I added contact xyz@xmpp.jp and logged in from credentials of abc@xmpp.jp.

    private void populateWithInitialContacts(Context context)
    {
    //Create the Foods and add them to the list;

    Contact contact1 = new Contact(‚Äúxyz@xmpp.jp‚Äù);
    mContacts.add(contact1);
    }

    6. Now,I have two different devices ready to communicate with each other such that I have abc@xmpp.jp in contact list of xyz@xmpp.jp and vice versa.

    7. But, when I select the contact to send the message there is no message received at the other end. However, In a case where sender and receiver is same message is received i.e. login from abc@xmpp.jp and adding abc@xmmpp.jp to contact list.

    I am helpless because I have invested much time in this tutorial and this tutorial is just what I need to start with. I would request some of your time to this issue, only then it will solve your purpose and benefit learners like us.

    Thanks in advance.

    I finally had some free time to look into the problem of messages not being received by Rooster and applied a fix.The tests I have conducted have shown that I can send and receive messages to/from Rooster and when Rooster is talking to another xmpp client.I used Conversations for this tests.The server I have used is Prosody 0.10.Hope this fixes the problem for you guys.
    The details of the fix can be found in this git commit :

    One question Daniel !!

    I am working on a chat app, yes a multi user chat having features alike whatsapp such as message notifications while app in background, user typing‚Ä¶, message sent-uploaded-seen by user, and many more as u know.. sending a voice/video recorded message and file transfer in a later phase..!!

    This tutorial seems very nice start for me.. does this project can be applied with these features ? Or the requirements needs some other way of implementation ? I know Rooster is using activities rather a tabbed activity and fragments but thats UI and its not as much concern.

    Thanks.

        Hi Jason,
        Yes Rooster can be a basis for your project but it really isn‚Äôt doing anything fancy.Smack is doing all the heavy lifting.If you want to extend it, you should read smack docs an you should be able to do most of what you want.

        However,there are many open source projects that have used smack to implement most if not all the cool features you want. Kontalk and Xabber come to mind. If you don‚Äôt mind basing your work on top of them ,they really are worth a shot.
        Good luck.

            Yes, Thanks Daniel !! I am seeing Xabber and conversations for reference.. a lot of code there mostly complex and will definitely need certain a level of programming to understand it. Kontalk I will just check it out.

            Thanks again for your fixes, app works like a charm !!!

                    Hey, most of these projects have years of development so they are understandably complex. I would suggest first laying down what you want to do in a list and take them down one by one. If you face any problem ask in the the smack/openfire MUC .If you are specific in what problem you are having ,somebody is usually happy to give you a helping hand.

        Hi,
        I am not sure I am getting your problem right, Rooster is installed on device A and B ,A can send to B and B can receive but B can send to A and A is not receiving?Also please post relevant debug output here so we stand a chance at seeing what is going wrong.Also the android versions your devices are running.

            I have installed the Rooster application on two devices (device A and device B). On both devices i have tried with same email password as well as different email password also. On both devices, I have tried with same contact as ‚Äòuser@testServer.com‚Äô as well as different contact also. But A just showing sent message but that message is not received by any device (not also device B). As it B just showing sent message but that message is not received by anyone. Means both devices just sending the message but not receiving the message. I trying with device A (Model :- M! 4W and version:- 6.0.1 MMB29M) and device B (Model :- vivo Y51L and version:- 5.0.2)
            Please suggest to me about this that how i can communicate with each other.

                Dont use vivo for testing !!! I had a bad time with it..!! vivo sucks with broadcast receivers, and also kills you app(main process and its service) as soon as you move out app from the recent app tray.

                Wasted my time and money on vivo.

    Guys..!! Message not received on other device issue is -SOLVED.

    Regarding the issue about receiving the messages on other device..

    First read the code.. let yourself know the process.

    inside chatActivity

    @override
    onResume()
    onBroadcastRecieve

    1 if ( from.equals(contactJid))
    2 {
    3 mChatView.receiveMessage(body);
    4
    5 }else
    6 {
    7 Log.d(TAG,‚ÄùGot a message from jid :‚Äù+from+‚Äùmsg is: ‚Äú+body);

    1. Line 1 : The code says it will only display a message in chatActivity if user and sender are same.

    2. Line 7: It does nothing just displays the message in log and You have to implement that part.

    Just try to send a message with sender and receiver as same.. check the debug logs !! U will see the message in chatActivity and in logs too.

        Hey,
        There is an Xmpp Extension Protocol ( XEP) for what you want to do.
        https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0085.html
        I haven‚Äôt used that with smack but a quick search came up with this link
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18436546/how-to-know-typing-status-in-xmpp-openfire-using-smack
        that may be a good start.
        Good luck.

    hi .
    this is an awesome tutorial.
    I m using Android Studio 2.3 and installed latest ejabberd. refactored the code to match to latest dependencies.

    dependencies {
    compile fileTree(include: [‚Äò*.jar‚Äô], dir: ‚Äòlibs‚Äô)
    compile ‚Äòcom.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.0‚Äô
    compile ‚Äòcom.android.support:design:25.3.0‚Äô
    compile ‚Äòco.devcenter.square:android-ui-library:0.1‚Äô
    compile ‚Äòorg.igniterealtime.smack:smack-android-extensions:4.1.0-alpha6‚Äô
    compile ‚Äòorg.igniterealtime.smack:smack-tcp:4.1.0-alpha6‚Äô
    testCompile ‚Äòjunit:junit:4.12‚Äô
    }

    When the android emulator loads with login UI, I am unable to login.
    Log message:
    Connected to the target VM, address: ‚Äòlocalhost:8630‚Äô, transport: ‚Äòsocket‚Äô, there is no exception

        I checked ejabberd, by executing following command

        sbin/ejabberdctl status
        The node ejabberd@localhost is started with status: started
        ejabberd 17.03.beta-63 is running in that node

        Hello Jason,
        Sounds interesting what you‚Äôre doing there. But I am more interested in explaining the process of building that so it is easy to understand for readers. Simply merging in new code would confuse people coming from this tutorial.
        If possible, would you like to document what you have done into a tutorial and post it somewhere? I would happily link to your work for people who want to take this further. That would actually have a huge audience as I get lots of emails requesting to take this to the next step but I currently I am short on time to do so.
        Let me know what you think.

            That will a lot of learners as I am one and I remember when your tutorial gave me a good start for my project. I would definitely like take it further.

            The code is pretty simple as yours. Commented and Logged pretty well.

            Since then, I have implemented receiving messages in background and notifications for messages as well.

            I will get back to you soon when I am done with my basic IM chat application and will work as you desired.

        The chatView is powered by a third party library in Rooster. May be they provide an interface to change backgrounds.You should check that. But if you do your own chatView, you can easily apply a background to the the root layout containing the RecyclerView. Of course that is if you use the RecyclerView. Hope this helps.

    Hi,
    Xmpp has some XEPs that handle different scenarios of sending files two come to mind:
    Jingle file transfer (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0234.html) and http file upload (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html) .You might want to check if Smack supports these (haven‚Äôt checked myself) and if it does do look at relevant docs.(There might be some other ways though,so my small list above isn‚Äôt exhaustive)
    Good luck.

    Hi,
    This is Great tutorial. thank you.
    for developing it, i need your help.
    I want to receive pushnotification in device when the special jid send broadcast message .so i try it :

    in the RoosterConnection.java :

    messageListener = new ChatMessageListener() {
    @Override
    public void processMessage(Chat chat, Message message) {
    ///ADDED
    Log.d(TAG,‚Äùmessage.getBody() :‚Äù+message.getBody());
    Log.d(TAG,‚Äùmessage.getFrom() :‚Äù+message.getFrom());

    String from = message.getFrom();
    String contactJid=‚Äù‚Äù;

    if ( from.contains(‚Äú/‚Äù))
    {
    contactJid = from.split(‚Äú/‚Äù)[0];
    Log.d(TAG,‚ÄùThe real jid is :‚Äù +contactJid);
    }else
    {
    contactJid=from;
    if ( contactJid.equals(‚ÄúspecialJid‚Äù)) // this is my code
    {
    Log.d(TAG,‚Äùdeliver:‚Äù+contactJid);
    RecieveServerMsg(contactJid ,matn );

    } //ending
    }

    //Bundle up the intent and send the broadcast.
    Intent intent = new Intent(RoosterConnectionService.NEW_MESSAGE);
    intent.setPackage(mApplicationContext.getPackageName());
    intent.putExtra(RoosterConnectionService.BUNDLE_FROM_JID,contactJid);
    intent.putExtra(RoosterConnectionService.BUNDLE_MESSAGE_BODY,message.getBody());
    mApplicationContext.sendBroadcast(intent);
    Log.d(TAG,‚ÄùReceived message from :‚Äù+contactJid+‚Äù broadcast sent.‚Äù);
    ///ADDED

    }

    };

    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
    and next add this function:
    public void RecieveServerMsg(String from , String msg) {
    Log.d(TAG,‚ÄùroosterRecivam :1‚Ä≥);
    NotificationView inst = new NotificationView();
    inst.addNotification();
    }
    //
    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì
    and next after create customnotif.xml , create NotificationView class:

    import android.app.Activity;
    import android.app.NotificationManager;
    import android.app.PendingIntent;
    import android.content.Context;
    import android.content.Intent;
    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.support.v4.app.NotificationCompat;

    /**
    * Created by sabina on 6/5/2017.
    */
    public class NotificationView extends Activity {
    int id = 1;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.custom_notif);
    }

    public void addNotification() {

    NotificationCompat.Builder builder =
    new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)
    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.icon)
    .setContentTitle(‚ÄúNotifications Example‚Äù)
    .setContentText(‚ÄúThis is a test notification‚Äù);

    Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(this, NotificationView.class);
    PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, notificationIntent,
    PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
    builder.setContentIntent(contentIntent);

    // Add as notification
    NotificationManager manager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
    manager.notify(id, builder.build());
    }
    }
    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì
    and in manifestAndroid:

        From : 07-03 11:07:40.467 31514-31840/com.blikoon.rooster W/AbstractXMPPConnection: Connection closed with error
        java.net.SocketException: Connection reset, it looks like the server is closing the connection for some reason. If you are sure the credentials you are using are all right, I would try with another client and/or other server. From the results I would be able to pin out what is wrong. Also do you notice the same problem by compiling the code from github? I can‚Äôt diagnose the problem without looking at your code. Hope this helps.

    Hi! I would like to ask if this is possible for a database (will be getting from http rest api) with a website that does not have xmpp? How would I know if it has xmpp? I am sorry, I am so confused. I‚Äôm an intern who was told to create an app based on the website another intern created.

    Was planning to use firebase but the website‚Äôs database is not designed for firebase.

        Sorry for the late reply Karl. I can‚Äôt really understand what it is you are trying to achieve. But if you want to communicate from android app to a web based xmpp client , that is very possible. You may know if the website uses xmpp by looking at its source code.

        Sure, you can implement the logic to pop up a notification when the a message comes in, have that in mind but haven‚Äôt had time to implement that yet.

            how can i make this app to login with another account instead of xmpp account? 

        What other account ? Can‚Äôt really be of much help without further details.

        Smack handles ssl certification for you on the client side. You just have to make it required like this

        setSecurityMode(ConnectionConfiguration.SecurityMode.required)

        On the server side, https://letsencrypt.org/ is a good candidate for your xmpp server.

        Hope this is helpful

    Hi thanks for the tutorial. my problem is that when i click to sign up, the process takes long and the log simply says
    LoginActivity: saveCredentialsAndLogin() called.

    and no other error.
    At times it signs in well. i cant tell why this happens. my internet connection is fast enough. please guide me

        October 31, 2017 at 5:12 am Reply	

        The login process usually takes long because of the ssl handshake happening between your client and server. It usually takes 10~30 seconds on my environment. But this really depends on your environment. Your connection might be good but your server might be not that fast on responding. But again these are just guesses. You might have to diagnose more to find out what is the problem here.

        Hope this is helpful.

        If I remember correctly File upload is provided by a plugin that was lately developed by the Openfire guys. You have to enable it somehow. I don‚Äôt use Openfire personally but you can ask in the ‚Äúopen_chat@conference.igniterealtime.org‚Äù MUC and you‚Äôll probably get better advice.

        Unfortunately I can‚Äôt know what is the problem without looking at your code. I would advise compiling the code from github and let me know if you are having the same problem.

        You need to use a separately configured XMPP server to use your XMPP client against. Please have a look at the introductory tutorial

    Hi,

    I have a question, does this client app connects with any xxmp server or specific server.

    Reading through this owesome tutorial, I am unable to see the specific parameters that the app use to connect to a specific server, parameters such as servername, port, etc.

    Once again thanks for the tutorial.

        Hi,
        Any XMPP server would work fine. You can read on the basics of xmpp here : https://www.blikoontech.com/xmpp/xmpp-a-soft-friendly-introduction
